# Unclear Error in Next.js 15: Missing Return Statement in Functional Component

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a functional component results in an unclear error message.  The error is difficult to debug because the message does not clearly indicate the missing return statement.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will encounter an error that isn't immediately clear as indicating a missing `return` statement in `pages/about.js`.

## Solution

The solution is simply to add a `return` statement to the functional component.  The improved error handling in Next.js 15 would greatly improve developer experience by providing a more precise error message.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of clear and informative error messages in frameworks.  Improved error handling can significantly reduce debugging time and improve developer productivity.
